// 12.Runes, graphemes and clusters
/*
In Dart, runes expose the Unicode code points of a string. 
Unicode defines a unique numeric value for each letter, digit, and symbol used in all of the world's wirting systems.

The usual way to express a Unicode code point is \uXXXX, where XXXX is a 4-digit hexadecimal value. For example, the heart character(‚ô•) is \u2665. 
To specify more or less than 4 hex digits, place the value in curly brackets. For example, the laughing emoji(üòÜ) is \u{1f606}

If you need to read or write individual Unicode characters, use the 'characters getter' defined on String by the characters package.
The returned Characters object is the string as a sequence of grapheme clusters.
Here's an example of using the characters API:
import 'package:characters/characters.dart';
var hi = 'Hi DK';
print (hi);
print('The end of the string: ${hi.substring(hi.length - 1)}');
print('The last character: ${hi.characters.last}\n');

The output looks something like this:
Hi üá©üá∞
The end of the string: ???
The last character: üá©üá∞

*/



// 13.ÂáΩÊï∞, Functions
/*
Dart is a true object-oriented language, so even functions are objects and have a type, 'Function'.
This means that functions can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions.
You can also call an instance(Ë∞ÉÁî®ÂÆû‰æã) of a Dart class as if it were a function.
*/

// Here's an example of implementing a function:
bool isNoble(int atomicNumble) {
  return _nobleGases[atomicNumble] !=null;
}
// Although effective Dart recommends type annotations for public APIs, the function still works if you omit the types:
isNoble(atomicNumble) {
  return _nobleGases[atomicNumble] != null;
}

// For functions that contain just one expression, you can use a shorthand syntax:
bool isNoble(int atomicNumble) => _nobleGases[atomicNumble] != null;
// The '=> expr' syntax is a shorthand for { return expr; }. The notation is sometimes referred to as arrow syntax.
// Only an expression (not a statement) can appear between the arrow (=>) and the semicolon(;). You can't put an if statement there but you can put a conditional expression.



// 14.ÂèÇÊï∞, Parameter
/*
A function can have any number of required positional parameters. These can be followed either by named parameters or by optional positional parameters.(but not both)
Some APIs, notably Flutter widget constructors, use only named parameters.

Named parameters: 
Named parameters are optional unless they're specifically marked as required. If a parameter is optional but can not be null, provide a default value. 
When calling a function, you can specify named parameters using 'paramName: value'. 
For example: enableFlags(bold: true, hidden: false);

When defining a function, use {param1, param2, ...} to specify named parameters: void enableFlags({bool: bold, bool: hidden})
Although named parameters are a kind of optional parameter, you can annotate them with 'required' to indicate that the parameter is mandatory that users must provide a value for the parameter.
For example: const Scrollbar({Key? key, required Widget child})
*/

// Optional Positional parameters: Wrapping a set of function parameters in [] marks them as optional positional parameters:
String say(String from, String msg, [String? device]) {
  var result = '$from says $msg';
  if (device != null) {
    result = '$result with a $device';
  }
  return result;
}
// Here's an example of calling this function without the optional parameter:
assert(say('Bob', 'Howdy') == 'Bob says Howdy');
//And here's an example of calling this function with the third parameter:
assert(say('Bob', 'Howdy', 'smoke signal') == 'Bob says Howdy with a smoke signal');

// Default parameter values:
/*
Your function can use = to define default values for both named and positional parameters. 
The default values must be compile-time constants. If no default value is provided, the default value is null.
Here's an example of setting default values for named parameters:
void enableFlags({bool bold = false, bool hidden = false})
enableFlags(bold: ture)

The next example shows how to set default values for positional parameters:
String say(String from, String msg, [String device = 'carrier pigeon']) {
  var result = '$from says $msg with a $device';
  return result;
}
assert(say('Bob', 'Howdy') == 'Bob says Howdy with a carrier pigeon');

You can also pass lists or maps as default values.
*/



// 15.main()ÂáΩÊï∞, The main() function
/*
Every app must have a top-level main() function, which serves as the entrypoint to the app. 
The main() function returns void and has an optional List<String> parameter for arguments 
*/



// 16.ÂáΩÊï∞ÊòØ‰∏ÄÁ∫ßÂØπË±°, Funtions as first-class objects
// You can pass a function as a parameter to another function. For example:
void printElement(int element) {
  print(element);
}
var list = [1, 2, 3];
list.forEach(printElement);
// You can also assign a function to a variable, such as: 
var loudify = (msg) => '!!! ${msg.toUpperCase()} !!!';
assert(loudify('hello') == '!!! HELLO !!!');



// 17.ÂåøÂêçÂáΩÊï∞, Anonymous functions:
/*
Most functions are named, you can also create a nameless function called an anonymous function, or sometimes a lambda or closure.
You might assign an anonymous function to a variable so that, for example, you can add or remove it from a collection. 

//An anonymous function looks similar to a named function
([[type] parameter[, ‚Ä¶]]) { 
  function; 
}; 
*/

// The following example difines an anonymous function with an untyped parameter, item. The function is invoked for each item in the list.
const list = ['apples', 'bananas', 'oranges'];
list.forEach((item) {
  print('${list.indexOf(item)}: $item');
});



// 18.ËØçÊ≥ï‰ΩúÁî®Âüü, Lexical scope
/*
Dart is a lexically scoped language, which means that the scope of variables is determined statically, simply by the layout of the code. 
You can "follow the curly braces outwards" to see if a variable is in scope. 
*/

// Here's an example of nested functions with variables at each scope level:
bool topLevel = true;
void main() {
  var insideMain = true;
  
  void myFunction() {
    var insideFunction = true;

    void nestedFunction() {
      var insideNestedFunction = true;

      assert(topLevel);
      assert(insideMain);
      assert(insideFunction);
      assert(insideNestedFunction);
      // Notice how nestedFunction() can use variables from every level, all the way up to the top level.  
    }
  }
}



// 19.ËØçÊ≥ïÈó≠ÂåÖ, Lexical closures
// A closure is a function object that has access to variables in its lexical scope, even when the function is used outside of its original scope.
// In the following example, makeAdder() captures the variable addBy. Wherever the ruturned function goes, it remembers addBy
Function makeAdder(int addBy) {
  return (int i) => addBy + i;
}
void main() {
  var add2 = makeAdder(2);
  var add4 = makeAdder(4);

  assert(add2(3) == 5);
  assert(add4(3) == 7);
}



// 20.ÊµãËØïÂáΩÊï∞ÊòØÂê¶Áõ∏Á≠â, Testing functions for equality
// Here's an example of testing top-level functions, static method, and instance methods for equality.

class A {
  static void bar() {} // A static method
  void baz() {} // An instance method

void main() {
  Function x;

  // Comparing top-level functions

// 22.Operators
/*
bitwise AND: &
bitwise XOR: ^
bitwise OR: |
if null(Á©∫Âà§Êñ≠): ??

In the operator table, each operator has higher precedence than the operators in the rows that follow it. 
For example, the multiplicative has higher precedence than the quality operator == , which has higher precedence than the logical AND operator &&.
That precedence means that the following two lines of code execute the same way:

//Parentheses improve readability
if ((n % i == 0) && (d % i == 0))...

//Harder to read, but equivalent
if (n % i == 0 && d % 1 == 0)...

/*
as: typecast
is: true if the object has the specified type
is!: true if the object doesn't have the specified type
The result of 'obj is T' is true if obj implements the interface specified by T.
Use the as operator to cast an object to a particular type if and only if you are sure that the object is of that type.
Example: (employee as person).firstName = 'Bob';
If you aren't sure that the object is of type T, then use 'is T' to check the type before using the object.

If the boolean expression tests for null, consider using ??
String plaryerName(String? Name) => name ?? 'Guest';

/*
Cascades allow you to make a sequence of operations on the same object. 
var paint = Paint()
  ..color = Colors.black
  ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
  ..strokeWidth = 5.0;

The code above is equivalent to:
var paint = Paint();
paint.color = Colors.black;
paint.strokeCap = StrokeCap.round;
paint.strokeWidth = 5.0;

If the object that the cascade operates on can be null, then use a null-shorting cascade (?..) for the first operation. 
Starting with ?.. guarantees that none of the cascade operations are attempted on that null object.

assert(text != null);

// Make sure the value is less than 100
assert(number < 100);

// Make sure this is an https URL
assert(urlString.startsWith('https'));

//To attach a message to an assertion, add a string as the second argument to assert
assert(urlString.startsWith('https), 'URL ($urlString) should start with "https".');

The first argument to assert can be any expression that resolves to a boolean valule. 
If the expression's value is true, the assertion succeeds and execution continues. 
If it's false, the assertion fails and an exception is thrown.

1) Properly specifying generic types results in better generated code
If you intend for a list to contain only strings, you can declare it as List<String> (read that as "list of string"). 
That way you, your fellow programmers, and your tools can detect that assigning a non-string to the list is probabbly a mistake:

var names = <String>[];
names,addAll(['Seth', 'Kathy', 'Lars']);
names.add(42);  //Error

2) You can use generics to reduce code duplication.
Generics let you share a single interface and implementation between many types, while still taking advantage of static analysis:
For example, say you create an interface for caching an object:

abstract class ObjectCache {
  Object getByKey(String key);
  void setByKey(String key, Object value);
}

/*
The 'import' and 'library' directives can help you create a modular and shareable code base. Libraries not only provide APIs, 
but are a unit of privacy: identifiers that start with an underscore(_) are visible only inside the library. 
Every Dart app is a library, even if it doesn't use a library directive

Using libraries: The only required argument to import is a URI specifying the library. 
For built-in libraries, the URI has the special 'dart:' scheme:
import 'dart:html';
For other libraries, you can use a file system path or the 'package:' scheme:
import 'package:test/test.dart';

Specifying a library prefix: If you import two libraries that have conflicting identifiers, then you can specify a prefix for one 
or both libraries. For example, if library1 and library2 both have an Element class, then you might have code like this:
import 'package:lib1/lib1.dart';
import 'package:lib2/lib2.dart' as lib2;
// Use Element from lib1
Element element1 = Element();
// Use Element from lib2
lib2.Element element2 = lib2.Element();

Importing only part of library: If you want to use only part of a library, you can selectively import the library. For example:
import 'package:lib1/lib1.dart' show foo; // Import only foo 
import 'package:lib2/lib2.dart' hide foo; // Import all names EXCEPT foo
